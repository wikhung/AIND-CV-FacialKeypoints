# AIND Term II, Computer Vision Capstone Project 
# Facial Keypoint Detection and Real-time Filtering

## Project Overview
This repository is my solution to the Computer Vision capstone project in the AI Nanodegree program. This project involves three components. 

__Part 1__: Preprocessed images and employed facial detection algorithm using OpenCV

__Part 2__: Using Keras to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the [Kaggle facial keypoint dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data). I also employed data augmentation technique to further improve the model performance.

__Part 3__: Demployed an end-to-end solution of detecting facial keypoints on any images. As part of the demo, picture of Barack and Michelle Obama was used to demonstrate the system's capabaility of detecting facial keypoints and apply appropriate image filters (i.e., putting sunglasses on the face).
